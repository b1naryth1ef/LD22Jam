It doesnt make sense... nothing is there. Where it should be... I can feel it... it was just there... where did it go? Where did I put it? I... I just dont remember... anything. 

- creatures start coming, freeze before they come

These creatures... they... they want to kill me. I know it. I... i think I remember. I see it. I remember... there blood... the warmth... where is it... what are they...

-LEVEL 1 MOTHER FUCKER

Fuck... where did they all come from? I can remember them. There fur. Pressing against me as they sunk there venom dripped incisors into my leg. I feel the poison rushing... its rushing to my heart... my heart races... I remember the guns... but I dont remember why... I remember the debates... the battles... always some friend of the creatures... rushing to there defence. 'SAVE THEM' 'LET THEM LIVE WITH US' 'THEY MEAN ONLY GOOD' there cries for saviorism where left unanwsered. There cries of mercy, from the very beings they defeneded, left unanwsered. Fuck these creatures... my head... its coming back... but not soon enough

-LEVEL 2 BROSKI!

I remember... no... i recall... something... the taste... the taste after they bite... so bitter... painfully so. They want us. Thats all they ever wanted. They dont care about the land, we could have mined it for the worthy lapis [+1 reference] earlier. Why where they so foolish... they wanted to let them live... let them live to kill us... if i didnt know better, i'd think they where on there side. But no. There just foolish... stupid even...

-LEVEL 3 DUCKERZ!

They recruited me... thats it... When they relisied, what they had done... they knew I was the only one. I was the savior. I was there king. My pistol in hand I set out... but what then? What... I must have saved them... thats it... distracted the little fuckers enough so my people could get away. Now i'm here. with no memory... alone... with the creatures of death... angels of hell... LEMONS... I NEED THE LEMONS... I know what to do! I can win yet... there dead souls will regret the pain they forced upon us... they will regret... and I will torture them, like they did the simple miners who came to help earn them a living... They. Will. Pay.

-LEVEL 4 GOOD SIR!
