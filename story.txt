It doesnt make sense... I lack it... it was there. I can feel the impression where it was. My memories, my life, my story... its gone. Where, where dit it go? What did I do with it... I just... I just dont remember. Anything. Why...

- Creatures start coming, freeze before they come too close

These creatures... they... they want to kill me. I know it. I... i think I remember. I see it. I remember... there blood... there warmth...  the taste... where is it... what are they...

-LEVEL 1 MOTHER FUCKER

Fuck... where did they all come from? I can remember them, but no more. There fur. Pressing against me as they sunk there venom dripped incisors into my leg. I feel the poison rushing... its rushing to my heart... my heart races... I remember the guns... but I dont remember why... Why are we here... who let them do this? Cripple us? Who left me? I can feel the emptyness of others. They left me... Why...

-LEVEL 2 BROSKI!

I remember... no... I recall... something... the taste... the taste after they bite... so bitter... painfully so. It floods back. My senses debhilitated from there venom. Almost dead... They want us. Thats all they ever wanted. They dont care about the land, we could have mined it for the worthy lapis [+1 reference] earlier. Why where we so foolish... Why where they so foolish? They told us to leave them be. Let them live while we mine the land. They wanted to let them live... let them live to kill us... if i didnt know better, i'd think they where on there side. But no. There just foolish... stupid even...

-LEVEL 3 DUCKERZ!

They recruited me... thats it... When they relisied, what they had done... they knew I was the only one. I was the savior. I was there king. My pistol in hand I set out... but what then? What... I must have saved them... thats it... distracted the little fuckers enough so my people could get away. Now i'm here. with no memory... alone... with the creatures of death... angels of hell... LEMONS... I NEED THE LEMONS... I know what to do! I can win yet... there dead souls will regret the pain they forced upon us... they will regret... and I will torture them, like they did the simple miners who came to help earn them a living... They. Will. Pay.

-LEVEL 4 GOOD SIR!

Its all coming back... I remember the day they prepared to leave the safe haven of our cave... They had given me a feast... it was brilliant. The glory I had. It was deserved. I was there savior... I was the one... I would leave them all, just to let them live. I could have killed them all... yes... I dreament of it before my time had come. They didnt deserve to live... they had sealed there fate when wanting to help the creatures... THEY HAD DONE THIS. But no... I was nice... I was the man who swooped in to save them all... And they left me. The fuckers... THEY LEFT ME, BECAUSE THEY HATED BEING WRONG. The shame of there incomphrensable stupidty compared to my genius. Let them run. I can fight these creatures... I will win... and when I return, they will all pay. THEY WILL BE TORTURED FOR THERE LIES AND STUPIDTY. THEY TRICKED ME, BUT NOT WELL ENOUGH. Not the lot of them can compare to my genius...
