It doesnt make sense... I lack it... it was there. I can feel the impression where it was. My memories, my life, my story... its gone. Where, where dit it go? What did I do with it... I just... I just dont remember. Anything. Why...

- Creatures start coming, freeze before they come too close

These creatures... they... they want to kill me. I know it. I... i think I remember. I see it. I remember... there blood... there warmth...  the taste... where is it... what are they...

-LEVEL 1 THE FUCK?!

Fuck... where did they all come from? I can remember them, but no more. There fur. Pressing against me as they sunk there venom dripped incisors into my leg. I feel the poison rushing... its rushing to my heart... my heart races... I remember the guns... but I dont remember why... Why are we here... who let them do this? Cripple us? Who left me? I can feel the emptyness of others. They left me... Why...

-LEVEL 2 BROS!

I remember... no... I recall... something... the taste... the taste after they bite... so bitter... painfully so. It floods back. My senses debhilitated from there venom. Almost dead... They want us. Thats all they ever wanted. They dont care about the land, we could have mined it for the worthy lapis [+1 reference] earlier. Why where we so foolish... Why where they so foolish? They told us to leave them be. Let them live while we mine the land. They wanted to let them live... let them live to kill us... if i didnt know better, i'd think they where on there side. But no. There just foolish... stupid even...

-LEVEL 3 TRAITORS!

They recruited me... thats it... When they relisied, what they had done... they knew I was the only one. I was the savior. I was there king. My pistol in hand I set out... but what then? What... I must have saved them... thats it... distracted the little fuckers enough so my people could get away. Now i'm here. with no memory... alone... with the creatures of death... angels of hell... LEMONS... I NEED THE LEMONS... [+1 reference] I know what to do! I can win yet... there dead souls will regret the pain they forced upon us... they will regret... and I will torture them, like they did the simple miners who came to help earn them a living... They. Will. Pay.

-LEVEL 4 GOOD SIR, IT'S TIME TO DIE!

Its all coming back... I remember the day they prepared to leave the safe haven of our cave... They had given me a feast... it was brilliant. The glory I had. It was deserved. I was there savior... I was the one... I would leave them all, just to let them live. I could have killed them all... yes... I dreament of it before my time had come. They didnt deserve to live... they had sealed there fate when wanting to help the creatures... THEY HAD DONE THIS. But no... I was nice... I was the man who swooped in to save them all... And they left me. The fuckers... THEY LEFT ME, BECAUSE THEY HATED BEING WRONG. I WAS THE VERY PICTURE OF MANKIND, AND THEY LEFT ME TO ROT. The shame of there incomphrensable stupidty compared to my genius scard them. A hanging clock above my head, the string twinging as it spun back and forth, the shadow casting itself to the surfaces of my pain. Let them run. I can fight these creatures... I will win... and when I return, they will all pay. THEY WILL BE TORTURED FOR THERE LIES AND STUPIDTY. THEY TRICKED ME, BUT NOT WELL ENOUGH. Not the lot of them can compare to my genius... 

-LEVEL 5 TRAITOR; ALWAYS; AGAIN!

Its so quiet. Everything... so still. This feeling. I dont know it. Its forgein. Have I won already? Do these vial beings conciete there world to the glory of my blazing gun? So easy... barely a scratch on me. And my memory... almost back... I can feel it edging towards me. But for now, I must go...

- clearly walks out of cave/thing. Only actualy cut-scene,

But no... the bodies of my comwrads... they lay strewn about. Something is wrong... and now the memories... they come.

The flight here. The landing, I convinced them we must take guns. 

Exiting the ship, the guards and me exiting with guns raised. 

The furry creatures... they didnt mean it... they...

The mining... and the plague. The creatures dieing around us... there life, there being drained...

The scientists made the connection, the lapis was there life force... it fed them... we where destroying them...

The sickness, a man in the camp, walking through veins was broken down with illness. The creatures, they couldnt keep away. Finally we let one in... it bit him, we where convinced he was gone

These creatures, not that, the fuzzys. The nickname given by the laughing campmates...

Ridiculed for beliving they where dangerous. 

The man was cured... walking again... these creatures had saved them...

The debate, they all agreed, we had to leave and take some of these creatures back...

I was wrong... how do i remember, how do I remember it all wrong?

But no, I couldnt let them. Deragned and convinced that the creatures would kill us all, I... no...

My mind tricks me, its dark corners slowly revealing the atrositices left behind...

I killed them... my friends... those that brought me and fed me, and cared...

The creatures too... all of them dieing... But no...

I found myself here, having killed them all, dieing of my own sickness...

It was cancer... the brain... it couldnt keep up... it was fading

I reset it... I found this room... the old hyroglpyhs reading the secrets

I was in a loop of destruciton, each time I got here I had to set everything back

I had to try... the creatures must live... 

They wanted to help...

They sensed pain, sickness...

I've done it...

I've killed them all

My friends...

My saviors

I've killed my Asclepius...

again.
