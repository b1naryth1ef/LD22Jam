It doesn't make sense... I lack it... it was there. I can feel the impression where it was. My memories, my life, my story... its gone. Where, where did it go? What did I do with it... I just... I just don't remember. Anything. Why...

- Creatures start coming, freeze before they come too close

These creatures... they... they want to kill me. I know it. I... i think I remember. I see it. I remember... there blood... there warmth...  the taste... where is it... what are they...

-LEVEL 1 THE FUCK?!

Fuck... where did they all come from? I can remember them, but no more. There fur. Pressing against me as they sunk there venom dripped incisors into my leg. I feel the poison rushing... its rushing to my heart... my heart races... I remember the guns... but I dont remember why... Why are we here... who let them do this? Cripple us? Who left me? I can feel the emptiness of others. 15 days... to much... I knew already. They left me... Why...

-LEVEL 2 BROS!

I remember... no... I recall... something... the taste... the taste after they bite... so bitter... painfully so. It floods back. My senses debilitated from there venom. Almost dead... They want us. That's all they ever wanted. They don't care about the land, we could have mined it for the worthy lapis [+1 reference] earlier. Why where we so foolish... Why where they so foolish? They told us to leave them be. Let them live while we mine the land. They wanted to let them live... let them live to kill us... If I didn't know better, I'd think they where on there side. But no. There just foolish... stupid even...

-LEVEL 3 TRAITORS!

They recruited me... that's it... When they realised, what they had done... they knew I was the only one. I was the savior. I was there king. My pistol in hand I set out... but what then? What... I must have saved them... that's it... distracted the little fuckers enough so my people could get away. Now I'm here. with no memory... alone... with the creatures of death... angels of hell... LEMONS... I NEED THE LEMONS... [+1 reference] I know what to do! I can win yet... there dead souls will regret the pain they forced upon us... they will regret... and I will torture them, like they did the simple miners who came to help earn them a living... They. Will. Pay.

-LEVEL 4 GOOD SIR, IT'S TIME TO DIE!

Its all coming back... I remember the day they prepared to leave the safe haven of our cave... They had given me a feast... it was brilliant. The glory I had. It was deserved. I was there savior... I was the one... I would leave them all, just to let them live. I could have killed them all... yes... I dreamt of it before my time had come. They didn't deserve to live... they had sealed there fate when wanting to help the creatures... THEY HAD DONE THIS. But no... I was nice... I was the man who swooped in to save them all... And they left me. The fuckers... THEY LEFT ME, BECAUSE THEY HATED BEING WRONG. I WAS THE VERY PICTURE OF MANKIND, AND THEY LEFT ME TO ROT. The shame of there incompressible stupidity compared to my genius scared them. A hanging clock above my head, the string twinging as it spun back and forth, the shadow casting itself to the surfaces of my pain. Let them run. I can fight these creatures... I will win... and when I return, they will all pay. I WILL TREAT THEM AS IF THEY HAD TAKEN MY VERY WIFE. A WAR OF NINE YEARS WILL RAGE. [+1 reference] THEY WILL BE TORTURED FOR THERE LIES AND STUPIDITY. THEY TRICKED ME, BUT NOT WELL ENOUGH. Not the lot of them can compare to my genius... 

-LEVEL 5 TRAITOR; ALWAYS; AGAIN!

Its so quiet. Everything... so still. This feeling. I don't know it. Its forgien. Have I won already? Do these vial beings conceit their world to the glory of my blazing gun? So easy... hardly a scratch on me. And my memory... almost back... I can feel it edging towards me. But for now, I must go...

But no... the bodies of my comrades... they lay strewn about. Something is wrong... and now the memories... they come.

The flight here. The landing, I convinced them we must take guns. 

Exiting the ship, the guards and me exiting with guns raised. 

The furry creatures... they didn't mean it... they...

The mining... and the plague. The creatures dieing around us... their life was draining...

The scientists made the connection, the lapis was there life force... it fed them... we where destroying them...

The sickness, a man in the camp, walking through bushes was broken down with illness. The creatures, they couldn't keep away. Finally we let one in... it bit him, we where convinced he was gone, poisoned by the ones who must already have hated us...

These creatures, not that, the fuzzies. The nickname given by the laughing camp-mates...

Ridiculed for believing they where dangerous. 

The man was cured... walking again... these creatures had saved them...

The debate, they all agreed, we had to leave and take some of these creatures back. Sickness was cured, and many lives would be saved...

I was wrong... how do i remember, how do I remember it all wrong?

But no, I couldn't let them. Deranged and convinced that the creatures would kill us all, I... no...

My mind tricks me, its dark corners slowly revealing the atrocities left behind...

I killed them... my friends... those that brought me and fed me, and cared...

The creatures too... all of them dieing... But no...

I found myself here, having killed them all, dieing of my own sickness...

It was cancer... the brain... it couldn't keep up... it was fading

I reset it... I found this room... the old hieroglyphs reading the secrets of time travel

I was in a loop of destruction, each time I got here I had to set everything back

I had to try... the creatures must live... 

If I kept trying, some itteration would be correct... I cant be all horrible.... I must try...

They wanted to help...

They sensed pain, sickness...

I've done it...

I've killed them all...

I've killed my Asclepius...

My friends...

My saviors...

Everyone...

And now I stand here alone, at the crossroads of pain. No one, no thing breathes. I've let them down... I've let them all leave me... The quiet, twisted, silence somehow brings me to peace... I must go back... I must try again...

again.
