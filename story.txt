It doesnt make sense... nothing is there. Where it should be... I can feel it... it was just there... where did it go? Where did I put it? I... I just dont remember... anything. 

- creatures start coming, freeze before they come

These creatures... they... they want to kill me. I know it. I... i think I remember. I see it. I remember... there blood... the warmth... where is it... what are they...

-LEVEL 1 MOTHER FUCKER

Fuck... where did they all come from? I can remember them. There fur. Pressing against me as they sunk there venom dripped incisors into my leg. I feel the poison rushing... its rushing to my heart... my heart races... I remember the guns... but I dont remember why... I remember the debates... the battles... always some friend of the creatures... rushing to there defence. 'SAVE THEM' 'LET THEM LIVE WITH US' 'THEY MEAN ONLY GOOD' there cries for saviorism where left unanwsered. There cries of mercy, from the very beings they defeneded, left unanwsered. Fuck these creatures... my head... its coming back... but not soon enough

-LEVEL 2 BROSKI!
